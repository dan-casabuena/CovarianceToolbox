# Covariance Toolbox üõ†Ô∏è
### A Python Library inspired by the CRAN R Package *Covtools*

_WARNING! Major work in progress... read and use at your own risk!_

Covariance is quintessential throughout many branches of statistics and machine learning. This library aims to fulfill the same usefulness as the CRAN package [CovTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CovTools/index.html), also utilizing pandas and numpy functions and structures.

TODO:
- [ ] Finish the rest of the library.
- [ ] Create test suite.
- [ ] Modularize common functions such as cross validation and matrix verification.
- [ ] Add proper documentation to functions.
- [ ] Setup `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` to include requirements and metadata.
- [ ] Work harder :(

Fun fact about the library:
The original intent of this project was to implement Bickel and Levina's Covariance Estimation by Hard Thresholding (2008). The intention of creating a whole library later came later when Bickel and Levina's method of Covariance Estimation was implemented within CRAN's `CovTools` package.
